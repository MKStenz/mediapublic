# There is an included fixture named "SkipAllFixture" which can be
# used to declare that all the tests in the given file are to be
# skipped.

# Each test file can specify a set of defaults that will be used for
# every request. This is useful for always specifying a particular
# header or always requiring SSL. These values will be used on every
# test in the file unless overriden. Lists and dicts are merged one
# level deep, except for "data" which is copied verbatim whether it
# is a string, list or dict (it can be all three).

defaults:
    ssl: False
    request_headers:
      # JSON ALL DAY
      content-type: application/json

tests:
  - name: Does anything work?
    url: /status
    response_json_paths:
      $.web: true
      $.database: true
